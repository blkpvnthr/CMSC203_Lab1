# Movie Information Input Project

This Java project allows users to input information about movies, including the title, rating, and the number of tickets sold. The program uses a loop to prompt the user for multiple movies until they decide to stop.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-information-input.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd movie-information-input
   
4. Compile and run the Java program
   javac MovieDriver.java
   java MovieDriver

5. Follow the prompts to enter information for each movie.
   - Enter the title of the movie.
   - Enter the movie's rating.
   - Enter the number of tickets sold.
The program will display the movie information using the movie's toString method.

6. After each movie entry, you will be asked if you want to enter information for another movie. Type 'y' to continue or 'n' to exit the program.
